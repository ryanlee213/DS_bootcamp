The Sith Lords are concerned that their recruiting slogan, "Give In to Your Anger," isn't very effective. Darth Vader develops an alternative slogan, "Together We Can Rule the Galaxy." They compare the slogans on two groups of 50 captured droids each. In one group, Emperor Palpatine delivers the "Anger" slogan. In the other, Darth Vader presents the "Together" slogan. 20 droids convert to the Dark Side after hearing Palpatine's slogan, while only 5 droids convert after hearing Vader's. The Sith's data scientist concludes that "Anger" is a more effective slogan and should continue to be used.
    - There should be one speaker for both slogans.  There could even be a duplicate test with the other speaker only.  
    - 50 does not seem like a large enough sample size for the entire galaxy...
    - and the participants are only droids... captured droids...
   
   
In the past, the Jedi have had difficulty with public relations. They send two envoys, Jar Jar Binks and Mace Windu, to four friendly and four unfriendly planets respectively, with the goal of promoting favorable feelings toward the Jedi. Upon their return, the envoys learn that Jar Jar was much more effective than Windu: Over 75% of the people surveyed said their attitudes had become more favorable after speaking with Jar Jar, while only 65% said their attitudes had become more favorable after speaking with Windu. This makes Windu angry, because he is sure that he had a better success rate than Jar Jar on every planet. The Jedi choose Jar Jar to be their representative in the future.
    - Jar Jar is in the argument.  Jar Jar is wrong.  Therefore, Mace Windu is right... also has purple lightsaber

    - Jar Jar Binks and Mace Windu are sent to different plants that have have different feelings toward the Jedi.  Therefore, Jar Jar, who visited planets that were already friendly with the Jedi, was expected to screw things up because he's the worst thing George Lucas ever thought of, and wind up with only 75% success rate.  
    - Mace Windu, on the other hand, badass that he is, went to the unfriendly planets.  And if the movies are anything to go by, getting 65% of the unfriendly planet's population to have improved attitudes of the Jedi seems like an enormous task, much more difficult than securing 75% of the FRIENDLY planet's population.  
    - Also, the fact that the Jedi Council do not recognize this at once and instead proceed to name Jar Jar as their representative (not just to those two planets from what I see in the description, but Jedi representative.), clearly indicates that Chancellor Palpatine is alive and well and using all his political strings to make this happen, thereby ENSURING the collapse of the Jedi Order, much like in the movies but in an alternate version of course.  
    - Also, "attitudes had become more favorable",  more favorable != favorable.



A company with work sites in five different countries has sent you data on employee satisfaction rates for workers in Human Resources and workers in Information Technology. Most HR workers are concentrated in three of the countries, while IT workers are equally distributed across worksites. The company requests a report on satisfaction for each job type. You calculate average job satisfaction for HR and for IT and present the report.
    - Since HR workers are represented in only three of the countries, when making the comparison with IT workers, IT workers from the two other countries should not be included.  Another test could be run with the two countries to see if the IT workers from those two countries are different from the other three countries and with HR workers as well.
    - Having more than one data statistic of the employee satisfaction rates can provide a better representation and visualization of the entire dataset.  
    
    
    
When people install the Happy Days Fitness Tracker app, they are asked to "opt in" to a data collection scheme where their level of physical activity data is automatically sent to the company for product research purposes. During your interview with the company, they tell you that the app is very effective because after installing the app, the data show that people's activity levels rise steadily.
    - According to the above description, "the app is very effective" based on the data showing "that people's activity levels rise steadily".  I am thinking this means that people are more active as time goes on after having installed the Happy Days Fitness Tracker app.  That seems to be more correlation that causation to me, especially because there is no way of knowing how long prior to installing the app the participants have been increasing their activity levels.  
    
    
    
To prevent cheating, a teacher writes three versions of a test. She stacks the three versions together, first all copies of Version A, then all copies of Version B, then all copies of Version C. As students arrive for the exam, each student takes a test. When grading the test, the teacher finds that students who took Version B scored higher than students who took either Version A or Version C. She concludes from this that Version B is easier, and discards it.
    - This incompetent teacher, who just coincidentally happened to be female, did not assign seats.  Maybe she used this method of distributing tests before and the students caught on.  Or the students just realized right away that their teacher was being way too naive and took advantage of the situation.  
    - On the less cynical side, the students with Version B could have just studied more than the other students.
