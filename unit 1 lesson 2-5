1. 

SELECT 
	*
FROM 
	listings 
ORDER BY price DESC
LIMIT 10

- The most expensive listing is not in a neighborhood group that any of following top 9 listings are in.  
- There's only one review and it's in 2014-12-22 (seems a bit long ago relatively)


2. 

SELECT 
	neighbourhood,
	AVG(price) price
FROM 
	listings 
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY price DESC

- Southeast Magnolia, Portage Bay, and Westlake have the highest avg price


3. 

SELECT 
	last_review,
	AVG(price) price
FROM 
	listings 
GROUP BY last_review

- prices seem to pick up in the summer and winter
