You're testing advertising emails for a bathing suit company and you test one version of the email in February and the other in May.
- General interest in bathing suits differ based on seasonality.  There may be a population of people that look to buy bathing suits when it is off-season for sales, but even that population would likely have changing feelings about bathing suits.  
- assuming that the reason for having such a huge time-gap for the two email-ads is to be able to clearly distinguish the reception of each email-ad, as the results of the test can be questioned due to any lingering effect the first email might have had if the second email-ad is sent a few days/weeks later...  (By having a large enough time-gap, the result is much less likely to be questioned). 
    - However, this approach is affected by the seasonality of bathing suits.  
    - Maybe a better approach in this context is to send both versions of the email-ad to each target audience within a much shorter period of time.  In order to address any doubts of which email-ad might have been the influencer (or just the better ad), the sample groups will be divided based on which email-ad they receive first.  There are external factors that can vastly change the results of a test (which is why multiple tests need to be run), so all of the variables that can be controlled will have to be taken into account for, no matter how complicated it may get.  
        - i.e., after taking into account the generic categories, the sample groups need to be divided based on factors including: shopping habits, fashion tastes, hobbies/activities, number of occasions where sample wears bathing suits - all of which appear to be detailed/tedious
        
        
You open a clinic to treat anxiety and find that the people who visit show a higher rate of anxiety than the general population.  
- People who are being treated for anxiety are likely being treated BECAUSE they have a higher rate of anxiety.  
- I think the test the client wants is a test to see if there is any variable that is significantly different between people who get treated for anxiety and the general population.  Through which those variables are tested for correlation with anxiety levels, and hopefully leading to a variable that may be the causality of the differing anxiety levels.  
    - just as an example, people who have higher rates of anxiety may all be smokers.
    

You launch a new ad billboard based campaign and see an increase in website visits in the first week.
- The "new" billboard-ad may have led to an increase in the first week, but afterwards, when it becomes an "old" billboard-ad, will it maintain the same levels of website visits as in the first week?  The new billboard-ad does not have enough samples (days) to be used to make any kind of conclusions.  
- I think the only option is to wait for more samples.  Judging from the scope of the hastily made conclusion about the success of the billboard ad, there is nothing else to do in order to receive data and make a conclusion of what the client is requesting.  
  - One option is to compare this "new" billboard-ad with its predecessor on a week-by-week basis, if that is what the client wants.


You launch a loyalty program but see no change in visits in the first week.
- Loyalty program usually take longer than one week in order for customers to be informed of it and to build up loyalty points, and even to build loyalty in customers that would lead to a visible change in visits.  
- Though it is still very early into the loyalty program, sales can be separated by whether or not the sale was made through the loyalty program or not.  Signups to the program can be a precursor to the success of the loyalty program.
