Drills
What are the three longest trips on rainy days?
Which station is full most often?
Return a list of stations with a count of number of trips starting at that station but ordered by dock count.
(Challenge) What's the length of the longest trip for each day it rains anywhere?


1. 

SELECT 
	t.trip_id,
	t.duration,

JOIN 
	weather w
ON 
	substr(t.start_date, 1, 10) = w.date
WHERE  
	w.events like 'Rain'
GROUP by 1
ORDER by t.duration desc
LIMIT 3


2.
